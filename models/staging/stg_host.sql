/*
This SQL script standardizes and transforms data from the source table 'host_snapshot' and loads it into the staging table 'stg_host'. 

The script first defines a CTE to standardize the 'host_since' column and another CTE to format it as 'YYYY-MM-DD'. It also standardizes the 'host_is_superhost' and 'host_neighbourhood' columns by replacing null values with the maximum non-null value for each host_id. 

The script then joins the resulting table with the 'property_snapshot' and 'stg_suburb' tables to obtain the suburb name for each host. Finally, it selects the required columns and loads the data into the 'stg_host' table.
